# Memory-Moog-Clone-KM
This is a personal document archive for recreating &amp; building the Luis Marka Memory Moog clone project.
The files shared here are mainly to assist fellow DIYers in building this monster.


Date 12-28-23: As of right now everything is in the planning & development process. I'll update this page as things come together.
Repository created! First and fore-most, my take on this project avoids the use of obsolete parts. For anything long out of production I've had to develope modern alternatives which  warrented some creative solutions. The only part for this project that is difficult to find is the HDSP-6508 display. Anyone refering to my documentation should source this part before all else!!! Consider it your golden ticket to the clone project ;)
I'm currently working out some of the mechanical drawings & sourcing hardware for bench-testing the circuit without a chassis. This includes;
Custom heat sinks for bridge rectifiers
Recreating the inner-dissipator for the PSU transistors
