# Memory-Moog-Clone-KM
This is a personal document archive for recreating &amp; building the Luis Marka Memory Moog clone project.
The files shared here are mainly to assist fellow DIYers in building this monster.
As of right now everything is in the planning & development process. I'll update this page as things come together.

First and fore-most, my take on this project avoids the use of obsolete parts. For anything long out of production I've had to develope modern alternatives which  warrented some creative solutions. The only part for this project that is difficult to find is the HDSP-6508 display. Anyone refering to my documentation should source this part before all else!!! Consider it your golden ticket to the clone project ;)

Repository created! I'm currently working out some of the mechanical drawings only for testing the circuit assembly. This includes;
Bridge Rectifier heat sinks x3
Inner Dissipator for PSU transistors
