# Memory-Moog-Clone-KM
This is a personal document archive for recreating &amp; building the Luis Marka Memory Moog clone project.
The files shared here are mainly to assist fellow DIYers in building this monster.
As of right now, everything is in the planning & development process. I'll update this page as things come together.

Repository created! I'm currently working out some of the mechanical drawings only for testing the circuit assembly. This includes;
Bridge Rectifier heat sinks x3
Inner Dissipator for PSU transistors
