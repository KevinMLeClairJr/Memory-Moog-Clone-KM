# Memory Moog Clone
This is a personal document archive for recreating &amp; building the Luis Marka Memory Moog clone.
The files shared here are mainly to log my progress and to assist fellow DIYers. While all documents are open source and available to the builder for DIY, PCBs proprietary products or services are not free. If you're interested in anything in this archive but not DIY, please reach out via email at KevinMLeClairJr@gmail.com
